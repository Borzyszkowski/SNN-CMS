## Explore Jet Tagging dataset

In this work, we explore the input files and different representations of data that they contain:
* A set of physics-motivated high-level features
* Jets represented as an image
* Jets represented as a list of particles 

These different representations will be used to train various kinds of networks while solving the same problem, a classification task aiming to distinguish jets originating from quarks, gluons, Ws, Zs, or top quarks.
